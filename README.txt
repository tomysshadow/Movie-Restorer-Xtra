Movie Restorer Xtra 1.3.7
By Anthony Kleine

	This Director Xtra allows Director to open and
	save Protected and Compressed Movie Files. It
	resolves the error message that occurs when
	using a hacked version of the Director API
	to save a compressed movie "Having trouble
	saving this movie." Works on movies that make
	use of Xtras such as Shockwave 3D Asset.

	The Movie Restorer Xtra cannot decompile
	Lingo Scripts, and `the scriptText` property
	will be empty in opened movies. It has been
	tested with a number of Director versions
	from 8 - 12.

	This Xtra is NOT Shockwave Safe.
